                                                            it is imperative to learn about the associated risk factors in order to

                                                            new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. each year and 609,640 people will
                                                            die from the disease in 2018 alone. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., 
                                                            and scientists predict that as the current population continues to age, these numbers will 
                                                            dramatically increase. This will have a major impact on many aspects of society, including economics. 
                                                            The NIH reported that in 2017, national expenditure for cancer care was $147.3 billion, 
                                                            and this number is also likely to increase in coming years. 
                                                            Given the unsettling implications of this data, action is required. 
                                                            The good news is that a substantial proportion of cancer risks can be significantly mitigated."),

"The lungs are truly special organs within our bodies, they are responsible for oxygenating our blood and without we cannot live. 
Our lungs draw in air from the atmosphere and utilize it and distribute throughout our body. 
For these reasons, anything that we breathe in can impact our health and therefore our risk of developing lung cancer. 
After many years of research, scientists now unanimously agree that tobacco use is the most important and significant risk factor for lung cancer. 
In the U.S., over 87% of lung cancers are related to smoking and other forms of tobacco use. 
Smoking not only impacts the person who is smoking, but also those around them. 
Second-hand smoke is another concern, as those exposed are also at risk of developing lung cancer.",

Brief help by a doctor (such as when a doctor takes 10 minutes or less to give a patient advice and assistance about quitting)
  Individual, group, or telephone counseling
  Behavioral therapies (such as training in problem solving)
  Treatments with more person-to-person contact and more intensity (such as more or longer counseling sessions)
  Programs to deliver treatments using mobile phones
  Medications for quitting that have been found to be effective include the following:
  Nicotine replacement products
  Over-the-counter (nicotine patch [which is also available by prescription], gum, lozenge)
  Prescription (nicotine patch, inhaler, nasal spray)
  Prescription non-nicotine medications: bupropion SR (ZybanÂ®), varenicline tartrate (ChantixÂ®)
  Counseling and medication are both effective for treating tobacco dependence, and using them together is more effective than using either one alone.
  More information is needed about quitting for people who smoke cigarettes and also use other types of tobacco."),
