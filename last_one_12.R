                                                            it is imperative to learn about the associated risk factors in order to

                                                            new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. each year and 609,640 people will
                                                            die from the disease in 2018 alone. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., 
                                                            and scientists predict that as the current population continues to age, these numbers will

                                                            The NIH reported that in 2017, national expenditure for cancer care was $147.3 billion, 
                                                            and this number is also likely to increase in coming years. 
                                                            Given the unsettling implications of this data, action is required. 
                                                            The good news is that a substantial proportion of cancer risks can be significantly mitigated."),
